# pico-jit - A just-in-time WASM compiler for the Raspberry Pi Pico

`pico-jit` is the project created for my Bachelor's dissertation at The University of Edinburgh. It performs templated compilation to translate WASM instructions to ARMv6-M assembly. I will probably add more to this readme when I can be bothered to do so.
